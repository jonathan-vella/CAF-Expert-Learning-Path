# CAF Hackathon

**Basic** - Strategy, Govern, and Plan

## Challenge 2

In this challenge you will have the opportunity to review the organization and understand how they can build a governance framework.

**Learning objectives:**

- High-level governance structure
- Skills readiness path; capabilities required for managing their cloud environment
- Cloud adoption team verified (RACI)

## Key Points to be covered

- Build a [skills readiness plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/adapt-roles-skills-processes) – what are the cloud skills or competencies required to be comfortable managing your cloud assets.  Have your team input the results in the ‘CAF Strategy and Plan’ Word template.
- Identify which potential roles would play a part in the cloud strategy team (leverage the [Cross-team RACI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/organize/raci-template.xlsx) “MVP” tab as a reference guide).
- [Governance Benchmark Assessment](https://cafbaseline.com/) – identify gaps between the customer’s current state and future state.

## Challenge 2 – Checklist

1. Build a repeatable skills readiness plan
2. Build a cloud strategy team (referencing the RACI chart)
3. **Bonus** Complete the Governance Benchmark assessment
