# Azure landing zone design areas

ach Azure landing zone implementation option provides a deployment approach and defined design principles. Before choosing an implementation option, use this article to learn about the design areas listed in the following table.

## [Environment design areas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-areas#environment-design-areas)

Whatever the deployment option, you should carefully consider each design area. Your decisions affect the platform foundation on which each landing zone depends.

## [Compliance design areas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-areas#compliance-design-areas)

Security, governance, and compliance are key topics when designing and building an Azure environment. These topics help you start from strong foundations and ensure that solid ongoing processes and controls are in place.

The tools and processes you implement for managing environments play an important role in detecting and responding to issues. These tools work alongside the controls that help maintain and demonstrate compliance.

As the organization's cloud environment develops, these compliance design areas will be the focus for iterative refinement. This refinement might be because of new applications that introduce specific new requirements, or the business requirements changing. For example, in response to a new compliance standard.

## [Design Area Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-areas#design-area-process)

These design areas describe what to consider before deploying a landing zone. Together, they establish a process to aid in exploring otherwise complex topics. These topics are typically involved in making critical decisions about your environment. Evaluate each design area to help you understand any changes you might need to make to the Azure landing zone implementation options.

Evaluating each of the design areas sequentially provides a process that simplifies the design of any complex environments. If you've already addressed one or more of the design areas to your satisfaction, move on to the next area.

In this process, you'll be provided with a list of roles or functions that are typically required to make design decisions. You'll also see a series of considerations, recommendations, and scope boundaries to help shape the discussion and decision-making process.
