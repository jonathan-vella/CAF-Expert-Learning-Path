# Welcome to CAF Expert learning path

This learning path is aligned with Azure Advanced Specialization Module A aka "The Cloud Foundation" module which evaluates the use of a consistent methodology and process for Azure adoption that is aligned with customers’ expected outcomes, spanning the entire cloud adoption lifecycle.

Azure AS Module A audit Cloud Foundation covers these 5 pillars:

1. Strategy
2. Plan
3. Environment readiness and Azure landing zone
4. Governance
5. Manage

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption (CAF) Framework is an iterative approach to support the digital transformation journey of an organization. It gives a collection of best practices, architectures and methodologies to ensure the integration of cloud into this journey. Having CAF experts in a partner organization enables the partner to become a trusted advisor not only for their customers on their journey to cloud, but also to Microsoft field teams. These “experts” can continuously generate more business with customers along an iterative journey of digital transformation.

## CAF Introduction

There are multiple sources to get a quick introduction into the Cloud Adoption Framework. There is a CAF learning path in the [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/microsoft-cloud-adoption-framework-for-azure/). This path is also the required pre-learning for the first module.

In addition there is [on-demand self learning path in german](https://caf-expert.github.io/caf-intro/) with a lot of videos and links towards tools and other supporting material.

## The learning path

The learning path is based on three main modules with multiple add-on modules.

- [Module 1: Cloud Adoption Framework - Basic](./caf-expert-basic.md)
- [Module 2: Cloud Adoption Framework - Migration](./caf-expert-migrate.md)
- [Moudle 3: Cloud Adoption Framework - Advanced](./caf-expert-advanced.md)

## Module 1: Cloud Adoption Framework - Basic

### Online pre-Learning Module 1

[Online self paced learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/microsoft-cloud-adoption-framework-for-azure/)

### Hackathon Module 1

This CAF Hackathon enables attendees to understand and get familiar on how the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF) can be applied with their customers. This hackathon walks through the Define Strategy and Plan phases of the CAF to support attendees in leading a client engagement that is considering moving their digital assets to Azure.

By the end of the CAF Hackathon, attendees will have built a cloud adoption plan that they can use to present to a customer’s C-Suite to justify adopting the cloud. The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with the tools and understanding that will complement the conversations attendees may be having with their customers.
