# Azure Architecture Center

> **[prev]** | **[home]**  | **[next]**

The [Azure Architecture Center] is a rich resource for cloud architects and engineers. Contained in its pages are patterns and practices learned from decades of building global-scale applications and operating cloud-scale infrastructure and services. FastTrack engineers use this resource every day; all of our advice is backed by the Azure Architecture Center and the greater Microsoft documentation site. Azure Architecture Center is open source and contributions are welcomed from the community.

## Application Architecture Guide
The [Application Architecture Guide] is a great resource for answering some of the big upfront questions that face architects. It guides the reader through different styles of architecture, illuminating the benefits and challenges of each style. The resource is great for anyone who is just starting the design process.

## Reference architectures
We have created and published a number of [reference architectures] across a wide number of solution areas. These are a great starting point for any architecture design session. Find a reference architecture that overlaps with your solution. Use what makes sense. Many reference architectures even provide Azure Resource Manager templates in GitHub to help you start your automation early.

## Design patterns
The Azure Architecture Center contains a [Cloud Design Patterns] section that explain how common problems can be solved with cloud architecture. There are a large number of patterns that span several types of considerations including reliability, performance, and managing complex deployments.

## Well-Architected Framework
The [Well-Architected Framework] is the inspiration of this discussion. The framework lays out key tenets in a series of pillars and provides guidance on technology choices and even provides a check list for each pillar. Our recommendation is to read the guide before starting a design session and use the checklists at the end as a measure.

There is also a [Microsoft Learn path for the Well-Architected Framework], which presents the same concepts in a guided discussion.

You can even [perform an assessment] of your own workload against validated best practices, which is a great way to start an architecture review session.

## Cloud Adoption Framework
The [Cloud Adoption Framework] provides Microsoft's guidance and recommendations for how to begin adopting the cloud in your organisation, from the initial strategic planning and assessments through to deployment of your workloads.

## Other resources
As well as the Azure Architecture Center, Azure provides other great resources to help you learn and use Azure effectively.

### Documentation
The [Azure documentation] is an open-source repository of authoritative information about the Azure products and services. This is the primary source for technical information about Azure services, as well as walkthroughs and quickstarts for many common scenarios.

### Azure samples
We publish a [large set of Azure code samples], which you can use to learn about Azure products or to quickly start building your own solutions.

### Azure Quickstart Templates
The [Azure Quickstart Templates] page gives you access to hundreds of Azure Resource Manager templates for many common deployment scenarios. This is a community-driven repository.
