# Requirements, requirements, requirements

👷🏻‍♂️🚧👷🏻‍♀️ (WIP)
Running a solution in the cloud doesn't reduce the need for your requirements to be clear. In fact, the flexibility and power provided by the cloud means that it's even more important to have clear requirements from business stakeholders; otherwise, you could end up solving for problems that don't exist, missing an important design decision, or going beyond the available budget by adding unnecessary resiliency.

Some key requirements that should be gathered upfront include:

* Who will the users of the solution be? Where are they physically located?
* What sort of request volumes will be seen? Are there targets for throughput and response times?
* How important is this solution to the business? Are there defined SLAs for uptime and availability?
* What is the impact of the solution being unavailable? Are there options for business continuity?
* What is the budget available - for development, operations, and running cloud resources?
* Does the business have compliance standards, cloud policies, or security policies that need to be followed?
* Who will operate the system in production? What visibility do they need into its components?

## Requirements gathering and planning
Have you got the right people involved? Including these people from the beginning will reduce friction as you move to production and ensure you have considered all the non functional requirements. To help kickstart these conversations we have created a list of starter questions

Procurement/Finance : Who's gonna pay and how 

IT : How are we gonna run this thing 

Identity Team (if different from IT) : Who is gonna access the subscription and its applications how will they authZ and authN 

Developers: How do we build and deploy apps 

Security: How do we meet compliance and security requirements 

Network: How do we connect to onprem resources and other azure subscriptions 

Workload / Business sponsor : What are the business drivers and other considerations we have to support
